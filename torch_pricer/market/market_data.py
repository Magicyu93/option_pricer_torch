"""What the market actually publishes.

These are the inputs to the curve and surface calibrations
(:mod:`torch_pricer.market.curve.calibration`,
:mod:`torch_pricer.market.surface.calibration`), kept strictly separate from
their outputs. A quote is an observation with a bid, an ask and a timestamp; a
curve or a vol model is a fitted object with parameters. Collapsing the two --
which is what a ``MarketSnapshot`` holding raw quotes would do -- makes it
impossible to say whether a number came from the market or from a fit.

Deliberately dumb: no interpolation, no arbitrage checks, no torch, no pricing
model. Validation that needs a model belongs in the calibrator that consumes
these.

The same holds for :func:`window_bars`, which turns the data pipeline's minute
trade bars into the observations a snapshot at the close is built from. There
is no bid or ask in that data -- only trades -- so the window does what a
spread would otherwise do: a narrow slot before the close, a minimum premium,
one maturity per expiry date. Dates go through :mod:`torch_pricer.conventions`
like everywhere else.

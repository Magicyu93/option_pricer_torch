"""The implied-vol surface interface every surface model implements.

A surface is a *description of the market's quotes*. It is not the dynamics --
that is a :class:`~torch_pricer.models.base.Model`, which is fitted to a surface
and knows how to produce an SDE. Local vol is exactly the map between the two,
which is why it deserves both a surface and a model.

Everything works in **total implied variance** ``w(k, T) = sigma(k, T)^2 T``
over log-moneyness ``k = log(K / F(T))``, and not in implied vol over strike.
Three reasons, all of which matter downstream:

* Dupire's formula is a ratio of derivatives of ``w`` in exactly these
  coordinates, and writing it any other way buys a page of chain rule;
* the no-arbitrage conditions are clean here -- calendar arbitrage is
  ``dw/dT >= 0`` at fixed ``k``, butterfly arbitrage is one inequality in ``w``
  and its two ``k``-derivatives;
* interpolating linearly in ``w`` between expiries preserves the first of those
  automatically, while interpolating in vol does not.

So a surface knows nothing about forwards: the strike-to-``k`` conversion is
the snapshot's (:meth:`~torch_pricer.market.snapshot.MarketSnapshot.vol`), with
the forward its curves imply. One forward, one source.

A new surface model implements :meth:`VolSurface.total_variance`, and
:meth:`VolSurface.initial` if it is to be fitted by
:func:`~torch_pricer.market.surface.calibration.fit_surface`. Its parameters are
``nn.Parameter`` s -- never coerced with ``float()``, since bucketed vega is a
derivative with respect to them -- and any no-arbitrage constraint lives in how
the raw parameters map to the model's, so that an optimizer can move them
anywhere.
